# Do Shall issue law reduce crime rates?
The discussion surrounding firearms and their influence on crime in America is highly debated. Advocates of state laws permitting concealed carry handguns argue that such measures contribute to crime reduction, emphasizing the importance of personal defense for law-abiding citizens. Organizations like the National Rifle Association (NRA) and various politicians support the idea of expanding gun-carry freedoms.

As a response to this perspective, numerous states in the United States have enacted right-to-carry laws, commonly known as shall-issue laws. These laws mandate that governments issue concealed carry handgun permits to individuals meeting specific criteria, including being adults with no significant criminal record or history of mental illness. Importantly, once these conditions are met, the granting authority is required to issue the license without the need for the applicant to demonstrate a "good cause."

# Research Objective:
This repository presents an investigation into the direct impact of the implementation of shall-issue laws on crime rates and violence across states in the United States. Leveraging 23 years of historical data for 51 states, our research delves into demographics, shall-issue laws, violence, and incarceration rates to assess correlations and implications. Our findings aim to contribute valuable insights to the ongoing discourse on gun control and public safety.

# Data Sources:

1. Demographic data
2. Shall-issue laws implementation details
3. Crime rates and violence statistics
4. Incarceration rates

# Methodology:
We employ rigorous statistical analysis, considering historical trends and correlations between the implementation of shall-issue laws and various crime metrics. Our approach includes examining demographics, evaluating violence rates, and scrutinizing the impact on public safety.

# Contributions:
By presenting comprehensive findings, we strive to offer a nuanced perspective on the relationship between shall-issue laws and crime rates. Our research aims to contribute valuable insights for policymakers, researchers, and the general public interested in the intersection of gun control measures and public safety in the United States.
